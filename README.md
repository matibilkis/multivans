## What is MultiVAns?

MultiVAns is an experimental extension of the [VAns (Variable Ansatz)](https://github.com/matibilkis/qvans) algorithm for optimizing **quantum combs** with communication channels. This work extends VAns to multi-party quantum protocols and quantum channel discrimination.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Channel Discrimination**: Distinguishing between different quantum channels
- **Multi-party Protocols**: Optimizing quantum communication protocols
- **Adaptive Quantum Circuits**: Circuits that adapt based on intermediate measurements
- **Circuit Database Representation**: Alternative circuit representation for quantum combs

## Important Notes

**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL/UNFINISHED CODE**

- **Development State**: Unfinished research code (~4 years old)
- **Framework**: Written in PennyLane (older version, ~0.15-0.20)
- **Compatibility**: May not work with current dependencies
- **Maintenance**: Not actively maintained
- **Purpose**: Research exploration only
